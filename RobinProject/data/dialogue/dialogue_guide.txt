A single conversation begins at this tag:
[DIALOGUE]
and ends at this tag:
[END]

Each piece of data consists of a tag and a value, each in quotes, like this:
	"tag"	"value"
You can put any kind of whitespace you desire outside the quote marks.

A dialogue must have a unique id anywhere between the start and end tags:
	"id"	"my_unique_id"
	
OPTIONS: The main guts of a conversation. Each option must be enclosed between curly braces, and looks like this:

{
	"option"	"about_gamers"
	"title"		"More about gamers"
	"you"		"Tell me more about gamers."
	"them"		"Gamers are cool and fun."
	"them"		"I love gamers."
	"you"		"Neat."
}

The "option" tag gives this option an ID, which must be unique to this conversation.
The "title" is what you see when selecting the option.
Lines marked "you" are said by the player; lines marked "them" are said by the other participant in the conversation.


You can set flags for options by placing this inside:
	"flag"	"flag_name"
flag_name can be any of the following:
	unlocked		(Option is available initially; otherwise it starts locked)
	lockWhenRead	(Option locks after being read; otherwise you can select it repeatedly)
	ends 			(The conversation ends when this option is selected)
	
You can have options unlocked other options by putting this tag inside:
	"unlock"		"option_id_to_unlock"
This will unlock the option with the given ID.
